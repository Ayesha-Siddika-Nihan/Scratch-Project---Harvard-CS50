# 🌸 *Geometric Dash — My First Ever CS Project*

> "*She had nothing but dreams, shaky Wi-Fi, and a stubborn heart.*"

During my gap year in Bangladesh, I jumped into Harvard’s [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) with nothing but a half-decent laptop and wild dreams.  
No CS classes. No mentor. No setup. Just vibes and audacity.

## 💫 Programming with Scratch — My First Step

**CS50x Week 0** was my first brush with code.  
Taught by the amazing **David Malan**, it was just Scratch — no syntax, just logic.  
But that simple drag-and-drop? It sparked something real.

I went deeper. Took **Brian Yu’s** *Programming with Scratch* course.  
**April 1st–3rd, 2025 — Eid days.**  
While the world celebrated, I stayed in.  
Coding. Creating.  
Made a game in 3 days. My first ever.

## 🎮 Final Project: Geometric Dash

**🧠 Concept:** Inspired by *Geometry Dash*. You control a block. It jumps. It survives.  
**⚡ Challenge:** It speeds up. Gets harder. You hang on.  
**🕹️ Controls:** Press `space bar` to jump.  
**▶️ How to Start:** Click the green flag. Chaos begins.

> Made with **Scratch**  
> Hosted by **Harvard**  
> Fueled by **late nights & daydreams**

## 🌍 The Bigger Picture

Most people had CS teachers, tech gear, stable Wi-Fi.  
I had:

- 🏠 **Rajshahi, Bangladesh**  
- 📖 **Social Science background**  
- ⌨️ **Self-taught Techie**  
- ✍️ **Prepping for SAT + IELTS**  
- 💻 **A wheezing laptop**  
- 📶 **Wi-Fi with mood swings**

But I kept showing up.

### ✅ Since Scratch, I’ve finished:

- CS50x (Intro to Computer Science)  
- CS50’s Intro to Programming with Python  
- CS50’s Intro to Databases with SQL  
- CS50’s Intro to Artificial Intelligence

And *this project*?  
It started it all.

## 💙 From Me, to the World

> *“I’m not in the top 1% because I’m gifted.  
> I’m here because I refused to give up.”*

Scratch wasn’t just a game. It was a *door*.  
To Computer Science.  
To my future.  
To the version of me I always wanted to become.

And I kicked that door wide open with nothing but fire in my chest.
