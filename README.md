🌸 *Geometric Dash — My First Ever CS Project*
</h3>

<p align="center">
> "*She had nothing but dreams, shaky Wi-Fi, and a stubborn heart.*"
</p>

In my gap year in Bangladesh, I found myself standing at the edge of an unknown horizon — diving into **Harvard's CS50x**.  
No fancy setup. No coding background. Just a half-decent laptop, shaky Wi-Fi, and a relentless curiosity that pulled me in.

<h2 align="center">💫 **Programming with Scratch — My First Step into CS** </h2>

I began with **CS50x Week 0**, *Introduction to Computer Science*, taught by the legendary **David Malan**.  
At first, I thought **Week 0** was all about Scratch — so I dove right into the deep end.

That's when I discovered another course — a whole universe devoted to **Scratch** itself: *Programming with Scratch*, guided by the incredible **Brian Yu**.  
Both courses became my *gateway* into the boundless world of computer science, and my very first, fragile leap into a vast digital landscape.

And then, during **Eid** (April 1st - 3rd, 2025), while the world was celebrating, I was locked in a room, immersed in the rhythmic motions of blocks and code.  
No distractions. Just me. A laptop. And three solid days of pure *learning*.  
I completed the entire course in **3 days**.

## 🎮 **Final Project: Geometric Dash**

**🧠 Concept:** Inspired by the game *Geometry Dash*, you control a simple block, dodging obstacles and leaping over challenges.  
**⚡ The Challenge:** As you progress, the game *speeds up* — it gets harder with every jump, every second.  
**🕹️ Controls:** Tap `space bar` to jump.  
**▶️ Start the Madness:** Click the green flag to start the chaos.

> **Created with:** Scratch  
> **Hosted by:** Harvard  
> **Crafted with Passion.**

## 🌍 **The Bigger Picture**

While most CS50 participants came from tech-heavy countries, I had:

- 🏠 **Rajshahi, Bangladesh**  
- 📖 **Social Science background**  
- 💻 **Self-taught techie**  
- 🖥️ **Laptop that wheezed when I opened VS Code**  
- 📡 **Wi-Fi that felt shy at the worst moments**

But I kept pushing forward. I kept showing up.

### ✅ **Since Scratch, I've completed:**

- CS50x (Introduction to Computer Science)  
- CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python  
- CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL  
- CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence  
- CS50’s Introduction to Cybersecurity

And this?  
This is where it all began.

## 💙 **From Me, to the World**

> *“I’m not in the top 1% because I’m gifted.  
> I’m here because I refused to give up.”*

Scratch wasn’t just a game. It was my *door*.  
To Computer Science.  
To my future.  
To a new version of me.

And I kicked that door wide open with nothing but **passion** and **drive**.
