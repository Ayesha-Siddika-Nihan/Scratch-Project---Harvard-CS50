# 🌸 Geometric Dash — My First Ever CS Project (Scratch + CS50x)

> "*She had nothing but dreams, shaky Wi-Fi, and a stubborn heart.*"

During my gap year in Bangladesh, I took a leap — straight into Harvard’s [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/).  
I didn’t know what I was doing. No fancy setup. No CS classes.  
Just a girl with a half-decent laptop and the audacity to try.

## 💫 Programming with Scratch — My First Step into CS

I started my journey with **CS50x Week 0**, titled *Introduction to Computer Science*, taught by none other than **David Malan**.  
At first, I thought Week 0 was fully focused on programming with Scratch — so I decided to dive a bit deeper.

That’s when I enrolled in another course, one specially dedicated to Scratch itself: *Programming with Scratch*, taught by the incredible **Brian Yu**.  
Both courses became my intro to the world of computer science — and my first tiny leap into a giant universe.

And during **Eid**, April 1st to 3rd, 2025 — while the world was celebrating — I was locked in, learning how to make blocks move.  
No cap, I finished it in just **3 days**.

## 🎮 Final Project: Geometric Dash

A simple game. But it meant the world to me.

**🧠 Concept:** Inspired by Geometry Dash — you control a block that has to jump over obstacles.  
**🔁 It gets faster. It gets harder. You survive as long as you can.**  
**🕹️ Controls:** Press `space bar` to jump.  
**🟢 Click the green flag** to start the madness.

> Made using **Scratch**, hosted by Harvard, crafted with pure passion.

## 🌍 The Bigger Picture

Most people taking CS50 are from tech-heavy countries with academic support systems.  
I had none of that. I came from:

- 🏡 **Rajshahi, Bangladesh**  
- 📖 **A social science background**  
- ✍️ **Self-taught Techie**  
- 🎯 **Prepping for SAT & IELTS at the same time**  
- 💻 **A laptop that wheezed when I opened VS Code**  
- 📡 **Wi-Fi that had stage fright at the worst times**

But I kept going. I kept *showing up*.  
Since Scratch, I’ve completed:

- ✅ CS50x (Intro to Computer Science)  
- ✅ CS50’s Intro to Programming with Python  
- ✅ CS50’s Intro to Databases with SQL  
- ✅ CS50’s Intro to Artificial Intelligence  
- ✅ CS50’s Intro to Cybersecurity  

And this?  
This project right here — is where it *all* began.

## 💙 From Me, to the World

> “I’m not in the top 1% because I’m gifted.  
> I’m here because I refused to give up.”

Scratch was just a game. But for me, it was a *door*.  
To CS.  
To a new world.  
To my future.

And I kicked it open with nothing but fire in my chest.
