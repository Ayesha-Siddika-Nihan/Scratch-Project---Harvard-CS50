### 💻 During my gap year in Bangladesh, I took a leap — straight into Harvard’s [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/).

No fancy setup. No CS classes.  
Just a girl with a half-decent laptop and the audacity to try.

## 🧩 Programming with Scratch — The First Brick

My journey kicked off with **CS50x Week 0**, taught by the legend **David Malan**.  
I thought it was all about Scratch… so I went all in.

Then I found **Brian Yu’s** full course on *Programming with Scratch*, and it became my comfort zone.  
Eid 2025? Everyone was out celebrating.  
Me? Locked in, learning how to make blocks jump — finished in just **3 days**.

## 🎮 Final Project: Geometric Dash

A pixelated block. Jumping for its life.  
But it meant the *entire universe* to me.

- **Game Concept:** Inspired by *Geometry Dash*  
- **Goal:** Jump over obstacles as it gets faster and tougher  
- **Controls:** `space bar` to jump  
- **Start:** Click the green flag

> Made with Scratch. Hosted by Harvard. Fueled by pure passion.

## 🌍 The Bigger Picture

Most CS50x students have labs, mentors, techy fam.  
I had:

- 🏡 **Rajshahi, Bangladesh**  
- 📚 **Social Science background**  
- ✍️ **Self-taught Techie**  
- 🎯 **SAT & IELTS grind**  
- 💻 **VS Code + Laptop = Lag Symphony**  
- 📶 **Wi-Fi that disappears like a ghost**

But I showed up. Again and again.  
Since then, I’ve conquered:

- ✅ CS50x: Intro to Computer Science  
- ✅ Intro to Programming with Python  
- ✅ Intro to Databases with SQL  
- ✅ Intro to Artificial Intelligence  
- ✅ Intro to Cybersecurity  

And this project?  
This blocky little game?  
It’s where it all *started*.

## 💙 From Me, To the World

> "I’m not in the top 1% because I’m gifted.  
> I’m here because I refused to give up."

Scratch wasn't just a tool. It was a *door*.  
To code.  
To dreams.  
To my future.

And I kicked it open — fire in my chest, stars in my eyes.
