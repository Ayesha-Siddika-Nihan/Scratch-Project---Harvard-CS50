## ✨ THE BEGINNING

Under Eid moonlight,  
in a small room in **Rajshahi, Bangladesh**,  
a girl with a tired laptop and zero background in tech  
took a leap — into **Harvard's CS50x**.

No CS classes.  
No mentors.  
Just passion, a spark, and a storm of curiosity.

> “Everyone said it’s hard. I said — challenge accepted.”

## 🎮 FINAL PROJECT — *GEOMETRIC DASH*

A block.  
A jump.  
And every line of code?  
A heartbeat.

> Inspired by **Geometry Dash**, this game is about rhythm and timing.  
> You press `space` to jump.  
> It speeds up. It gets chaotic. You survive. That’s it.  
> Just like life.

[▶️ **PLAY THE GAME**](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1155594303) — *Made in Scratch. Coded with chaos and care.*

## 💙 CONTEXT MATTERS

While most had labs, mentors, a setup…  
I had:

- 📍 A room in **Rajshahi**  
- 📚 **Humanities** student with a tech dream  
- 💻 A laptop that wheezed louder than my thoughts  
- 📡 Internet that ghosted me mid-lecture  
- ⏳ Prepping for **SAT & IELTS** at the same time

Still, I showed up.  
Still, I coded.  
Still, I conquered.

## 🛤️ WHERE SCRATCH LED ME

This small project sparked a wildfire.  
Since then, I’ve finished:

- ✅ **CS50x** — Intro to Computer Science  
- ✅ CS50’s **Programming with Python**  
- ✅ CS50’s **Databases with SQL**  
- ✅ CS50’s **AI**  
- ✅ CS50’s **Cybersecurity**

And every journey traces back  
to this little jumping block.

## 🌠 MESSAGE TO THE WORLD

> “I’m not in the top 1% because I’m gifted.  
> I’m here because I refused to quit.”

I’m not just learning computer science.  
I’m rewriting my own narrative.  
With Scratch, I didn’t just build a game.  
I built **belief**.
